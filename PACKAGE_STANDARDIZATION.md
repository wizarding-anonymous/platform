# Package Standardization Guidelines

This document outlines the recommended standard packages and libraries for common tasks across microservices. Adhering to these standards helps in maintaining consistency, reducing boilerplate, improving security, and simplifying dependency management.

## 1. Guiding Principles

*   **Consistency:** Use the same library for the same task across different microservices where feasible.
*   **Community Support & Maturity:** Prefer well-maintained, widely adopted libraries with active communities.
*   **Performance:** Consider the performance implications of a library, especially for critical path operations.
*   **Security:** Choose libraries with a good security track record. Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
*   **Licensing:** Ensure library licenses are compatible with the project's licensing requirements.
*   **Minimalism:** Avoid adding unnecessary dependencies. If a feature can be easily achieved with native language capabilities or an existing library, prefer that.

## 2. Recommended Standard Packages

This section will be populated based on the primary programming language(s) used for microservices. Assuming a primary language like **Go** or **Python** or **Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)**, examples are provided. Specify the language and then list packages.

**If the primary language is not yet defined, this section should state that and recommend defining it first.**

### 2.1. Node.js / TypeScript

*   **HTTP Client:**
    *   **`axios`**: Promise-based HTTP client for the browser and node.js. Widely used, feature-rich, and well-documented.
    *   *Alternative:* `node-fetch` (for a more lightweight, standard Fetch API experience).
*   **Logging:**
    *   **`pino`**: Extremely fast, JSON-based logger. Good for structured logging.
    *   *Alternative:* `winston` (more flexible, supports multiple transports).
*   **Web Framework (for REST APIs):**
    *   **`Express.js`**: Minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework. Vast ecosystem.
    *   *Alternative:* `Fastify` (focus on speed and low overhead). Consider if performance is paramount.
*   **gRPC Implementation:**
    *   **`@grpc/grpc-js`** and **`@grpc/proto-loader`**: Official gRPC libraries for Node.js.
*   **Environment Variables Management:**
    *   **`dotenv`**: Loads environment variables from a `.env` file.
*   **Date/Time Manipulation:**
    *   **`date-fns`** or **`luxon`**: Modern libraries for date/time manipulation, offering immutability and I18N support. Avoid Moment.js for new projects due to its mutability and size.
*   **Validation:**
    *   **`joi`** or **`zod`** (especially for TypeScript): Powerful schema description language and data validator.
*   **UUID Generation:**
    *   **`uuid`**: For creating RFC4122 UUIDs.
*   **Testing:**
    *   **`Jest`**: A delightful JavaScript Testing Framework with a focus on simplicity.
    *   *Alternatives:* `Mocha` (flexible, often paired with `Chai` for assertions).
*   **ORM/Database Interaction (PostgreSQL Example):**
    *   **`pg` (node-postgres)**: Non-blocking PostgreSQL client for Node.js.
    *   **`Sequelize`** or **`TypeORM`** (for TypeScript): Promise-based Node.js ORM for Postgres, MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite and Microsoft SQL Server. Choose one and stick to it.
*   **Caching Client (Redis Example):**
    *   **`ioredis`**: A robust, performance-focused and full-featured Redis client for Node.js.
*   **Message Queue Client (Kafka Example):**
    *   **`kafkajs`**: A modern Apache Kafka client for Node.js.

## 3. Process for Adding New Standard Packages

1.  **Proposal:** If a new common task requires a library, or a better alternative to an existing standard is found, a developer can propose it. The proposal should include justification (why this library, alternatives considered).
2.  **Review:** The proposal should be reviewed by the Architecture Team or designated senior developers. Factors like those in Section 1 (Guiding Principles) will be considered.
3.  **Decision & Documentation:** If approved, the library is added to this document.
4.  **Communication:** The decision should be communicated to all development teams.

## 4. Versioning and Updates

*   It is recommended to use a dependency management tool (e.g., `npm`, `yarn`, `go mod`, `pip`) and define specific versions for packages.
*   Regularly review and update dependencies to their latest stable versions to incorporate bug fixes, performance improvements, and security patches. Tools like `npm audit` or GitHub's Dependabot can help identify vulnerabilities.
*   Major version upgrades of standard packages should be discussed and planned, as they might introduce breaking changes.

This document serves as a living guideline and should be updated as the project evolves and new needs arise.
